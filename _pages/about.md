When Mooreâ€™s law hits the limit, performance improvement increasingly depends on parallelism and special purpose processors. 
Software infrastructure that allow easy and fast parallelism programming development/test, 
and effectively utilize heterogeneous processors at run time is playing catch up. 
This project tries to address a few pressing needs
Provide a lightweight runtime system that support computation and data movement in 
massive concurrency that directly leverage low level hardware resource for enterprise storage (IO intensive) 
and HPC workload (Compute intensive), which dynamically matches requirements from application and hardware resource,
scheduling based on power, resilience, memory locality and processor capabilities.
Research on critical aspect in heterogeneous compute, such as memory management, scheduling and software package deployment.
