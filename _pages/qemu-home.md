## Mission statement  

[QEMU](/qemu/getting_started) emulation of ARM systems is a valuable piece of software infrastructure, which enables the rapid and seamless adoption of ARM based hardware into a data center ecosystem.

Today there are limits on the configuration and scaling of ARM systems within QEMU system emulation.  For example, the number of ARM cores is limited to [123](qemu-arm-about-the-123-core-limit) under a typical QEMU configuration.

Moreover the scaling of QEMU with large numbers of cores limits the practical usable number of cores to about half that 123 core limit in many cases.

Our goal is to enable QEMU emulation of ARM systems with an emphasis on scaling to large numbers of cores.
